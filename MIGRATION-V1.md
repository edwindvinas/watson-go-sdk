Here are simple steps to move from `v0.11.0` to `v1.0.0`.

## AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM

The constructor no longer accepts individual credentials like `IAMApiKey`, etc. We initialize authenticators from the [core](https://github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core). The core supports various authentication mechanisms, choose the one appropriate to your instance and use case.

For example, to pass a IAM apikey:
#### Before
```go
service, serviceErr := servicev1.
NewServiceV1(&servicev1.ServiceV1Options{
    URL: "{url}",
    IAMApiKey: "{apikey}",
})
```

#### After(V1.0)
```go
import "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"

authenticator := &core.IamAuthenticator{
    ApiKey:     "{apikey}",
}

service, serviceErr := servicev1.
NewServiceV1(&servicev1.ServiceV1Options{
    URL: "{url}",
    Authenticator: authenticator,
})
```

There are 5 authentication variants supplied in the SDK (shown below): You can also find detailed explanation [Authentication](https://github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/blob/master/Authentication.md)

#### BasicAuthenticator
```go
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)

authenticator := &core.BasicAuthenticator{
    Username: "user1", 
    Password: "password1",
}
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: authenticator,
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

#### BearerTokenAuthenticator
```go
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)

authenticator := &core.BearerTokenAuthenticator{
    BearerToken: token,
}
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: authenticator,
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

#### CloudPakForDataAuthenticator
```go
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)

authenticator := &core.CloudPakForDataAuthenticator{
    URL:                    "https://my-cp4d-url"
    Username:               "user1", 
    Password:               "password1",
    DisableSSLVerification: true,
}
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: authenticator,
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

#### IAMAuthenticator
```python
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)
...
authenticator := &core.IamAuthenticator{
    ApiKey:     "my-iam-apikey",
}
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: authenticator,
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

#### NoAuthAuthenticator
```go
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)
...
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: &core.NoAuthAuthenticator{},
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

#### Creating an Authenticator from Environmental Configuration
External env variables can be obtained from CREDENTIALS, Environment variables or VCAP_SERVICES

```go
import (
    "github.com/IBM/go-sdk-core/core"
    "<appropriate-git-repo-url>/myservicev1"
)
...
authenticator := core.GetAuthenticatorFromEnvironment("my_service")
options := &myservicev1.MyServiceV1Options{
    Authenticator: authenticator,
}
service := myservicev1.NewMyServiceV1(options)
```

## METHOD CALLS RETURN FIRST PARAM AS RESULT
For functions which have a result, method calls will return `result` as the first param

#### Before
```go
response, responseErr := service.MethodCall(&servicev1.MethodCallOptions{})

result := discovery.GetListEnvironmentsResult(response)
```

#### After(V1.0)
Result would be returned directly

```go
result, response, responseErr := service.MethodCall(&servicev1.MethodCallOptions{})
```
